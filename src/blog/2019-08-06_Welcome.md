# Welcome to my blog 

Hi my name is Ian Stanley and I am planning on keeping a blog on the Raspberry Pi and other similar systems.

## About Me
With well over a couple of decades in the IT industry focussing on \*nix Administration of all sorts of flavours from System V, through BSD/FreeBSD, Solaris, AIX and Linux (since it fit on 3 floopy disks and you had to compile everything yourself) I have tinkered a lot over the years at home with Linux and FreeBSD.
 
As I generally avoid Windows and no longer choose to pay the *Apple Tax* I have been migrating my life off Windows and OSX now that I no longer forced to use Windows and Apple no longer cares about it's customers.

I now have my own personal FreeBSD server in my house as my mainstay, another AcePC mini-PC running FreeBSD as a FreeBSD dev box. I also have a number of Raspberry Pi's as semi-disposable machines that I spin up from time to time as a project demands.
